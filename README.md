[NYPD Complaint Data Used For This Project](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-/5uac-w243)

## File Explanation
- **Data** contains the data that was used to for the dashbord. In order to run the udpatedintro.py, these files are needed. Due to it being a large file, NYPD_Complaint_Data_Cleaned.csv is not in the data folder, but rather it is a link to the file.
- **README.md** this is the file you are reading right now
- **complaint-data-notebook.ipynb** is the jupyter notebook we used to do the early stage data cleaning and visualization  
- **intro.py** is an early stage of our dashboard.
- **updatedintro.py** is the completed dashboard
- **testingZipCode.ipynb** and **zipCodeFunction.ipynb** are a zip code function we tried to implement into the project, due to time constraints we could not complete.

## Summary of Project
- As a group we created a dashboard using python that looks into NYPD Complaints for the year of 2021.
